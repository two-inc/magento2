/**
 * Pre-existing gap this PR closes: Model\Total\Invoice\Surcharge::collect()
 * pours the remaining surcharge net into invoice.grand_total and its VAT
 * into invoice.tax_amount (via Magento's native tax collector), but
 * ComposeCapture::getLineItemsInvoice() never turned that into a line item —
 * there was no 'surcharge' entry alongside 'shipping'. Without this line,
 * the new Order::getOtherChargesLineItem() fallback would mistake Two's own
 * known BUYER_FEE for an unrecognized third-party fee on every capture of a
 * surcharge-bearing order (caught in review — see PR discussion).
 *
 * Uses the real faithful DataObject-semantics stubs from
 * Test/Stubs/SalesModels.php (magic get/set matching Magento's), not mocks,
 * so this exercises getLineItemsInvoice()'s real code path rather than a
 * pre-canned expectation.
