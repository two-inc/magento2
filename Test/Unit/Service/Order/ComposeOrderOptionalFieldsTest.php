/**
 * TWO-25386: optional payload fields must be omitted rather than composed as
 * empty strings, for two separate reasons.
 *
 * vendor_name cannot be blank while the key is present, so a blank admin
 * setting sent as '' had the order rejected and nothing created at all. The
 * remaining fields never caused a rejection; they are omitted because of what
 * an omitted key means to the later order-edit call. Those field constraints
 * and the edit-merge semantics are recorded on TWO-25386. What the plugin did
 * wrong: an admin order-address edit re-composed the payload and sent
 * buyer_purchase_order_number and order_note blank (buyer_department and
 * buyer_project were forwarded from the stored additional_information).
 *
 * The getters are allowed to return '' (see
 * Model\Config\RepositoryAdminControlsTest) — it is the caller's job to leave
 * the key out, which is what this covers.
 *
 * Builds ComposeOrder via getMockBuilder() with the constructor disabled and
 * only the heavy collaborating helpers replaced, so execute() itself runs its
 * real implementation — same pattern as ComposeCaptureSurchargeLineTest.
