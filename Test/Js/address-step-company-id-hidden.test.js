 * TWO-25288. A CSS-only hide of the address step's separate "Company Number"
 * field. The field an earlier TWO-25288 change made real and editable — see
 * address-company-id.test.js — stays present and functional; only its visual
 * rendering changes.
 *
 * This file used to also pin a grey inline hint of the registry id beside the
 * payment tile's company-name field. That hint is GONE: the tile now shows the
 * number as a labelled read-only input of its own, which supersedes it, and
 * rendering both would have shown the buyer the same number twice. The
 * replacement is pinned by tile-company-readonly-fields.test.js.
 *
 * What is NOT asserted here: `companyId` reaching getData() and the writer
 * enumeration for it. Those are pinned by
 * gateway-method-company-selection.test.js and
 * tile-company-readonly-fields.test.js; duplicating them would only drift.
