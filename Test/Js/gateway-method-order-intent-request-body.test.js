 * TWO-25365 — the order-intent request's `buyer.company` object carries only
 * fields about the BUYER's company.
 *
 * Luma used to send `buyer.company.website = window.BASE_URL`. That global is
 * the MERCHANT's own storefront URL, so every order intent claimed the
 * merchant's site as the buying company's website — wrong data under a field
 * name that says something else. The field is not part of the request this
 * renderer is meant to send, and this module's own PHP order-create path
 * (`Service\Order`) never sent it either, so it is gone rather than re-sourced
 * from somewhere else. See TWO-25365 for the API-side reference.
 *
 * The behavioural spec below composes a real request body and asserts on the
 * JSON that would go on the wire, with `window.BASE_URL` deliberately SET — a
 * spec run against a sandbox with no BASE_URL would pass on the missing global
 * rather than on the composition.
