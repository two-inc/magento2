 * TWO-25503. `view/frontend/web/js/model/company-search-panel.js` is one of two
 * copies of the same panel module, so two checkouts render one control. The
 * copies are byte-identical, and `EDIT_LOCK_SHA256` below is what says so: the
 * WooCommerce plugin's own suite locks its copy to the same digest, so two
 * matching constants are the whole parity check, and two different ones are the
 * drift.
 *
 * To change shared panel behaviour: edit here, apply the identical edit to the
 * other copy, re-run both JS suites, and move both digests in the same change
 * set.
