 * Smoke-load test for every JS file shipped by the module. Each file
 * is loaded through the AMD harness with mocked Magento RequireJS
 * deps and asserted to return *something* (i.e. didn't throw mid-eval,
 * didn't fail to register, didn't reference an unmocked dep).
 *
 * Catches:
 *   - syntax errors
 *   - typos in dep paths (would surface as "unmocked dep" failures here)
 *   - factory functions that throw at load time
 *
 * Does NOT exercise the deep behaviour of each module — those need
 * dedicated test files (see brand-config.test.js for an example).
