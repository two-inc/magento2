 *
 * TWO-25461 — a completed sole-trader signup writes the buyer's registered
 * ADDRESS, not just their identity.
 *
 * `/autofill/v1/buyer/current` has always answered with the address beside the
 * organisation number and company name, and the call sites that consumed it
 * read the two identity fields and threw the address away — so a buyer who had
 * just enrolled was asked to retype an address the plugin was holding.
 *
 * Two rules are the ones most likely to be "tidied" back into a bug, and each
 * has its own case below:
 *
 *  - the write is NOT gated on the address-lookup switch that gates an ordinary
 *    company-search selection. That switch is legitimately off wherever company
 *    search is not mounted in the address area, which is exactly where this
 *    flow lives, so gating here leaves the write permanently dead;
 *  - the write happens ONCE PER IDENTITY, so a replayed ACCEPTED cannot
 *    overwrite a correction the buyer made after the first write — and
 *    `forgetAdoptions()` is what re-arms it.
 *
 * Field routing itself is pinned against the real shared model in
 * company-search-address-field-routing.test.js; the double here records the
 * payload and the scope handed to it, which is what this surface owns.
