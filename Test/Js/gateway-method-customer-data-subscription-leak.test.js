 * TWO-25347: fillCustomerData() subscribes to shared quote/customerData
 * singletons and, before this fix, never disposed the previous set on a
 * re-render — dispose() tore down only `_twoVisibilitySub`. fillCustomerData()
 * is re-callable and Fire Checkout re-renders this payment renderer on every
 * totals/shipping change, so stacked subscriptions accumulated fast enough to
 * be visible there: a single company pick fired one order_intent POST per
 * SURVIVING subscription, not one.
 *
 * The `countryCode` customer-data subscription this file used to count is gone
 * (TWO-25503) — the capture component's delegated country watcher replaced it —
 * so the counts below are over the three singletons that remain.
 *
 * These specs use a real-dispose observable double (the shared harness's
 * makeObservable() stubs dispose() as a no-op, which would make this fix
 * untestable against it) to prove the actual subscriber count, not just that
 * dispose() was called.
