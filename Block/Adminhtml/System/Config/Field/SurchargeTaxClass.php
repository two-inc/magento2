/**
 * Renderer for the Surcharge tax treatment field: fails LOUD when the
 * value this scope has stored is a never-taxed treatment (TWO-25279).
 *
 * Never-taxed treatments — core "None" (Product Tax Class id 0) and the
 * "Payment Terms Surcharge - No Tax" class the plugin used to provision —
 * are no longer offered in the dropdown, and are refused at save time by
 * Two\Gateway\Model\Config\Backend\SurchargeTaxClass. There is
 * deliberately no grandfathering, which leaves one case to handle
 * honestly: a scope configured before this change, or written outside the
 * admin form, that still holds such a value.
 *
 * That scope is NOT silently corrected and NOT silently left on a zero.
 * The merchant sees an error on the field itself telling them to select a
 * real tax rule. Doing nothing would be the worst option: the select
 * cannot render a value absent from its options, so it falls back to the
 * placeholder and the field simply looks unset, giving no hint that the
 * surcharge is currently being charged untaxed.
 *
 * Reads $element->getValue(), NOT config: Magento has already resolved
 * the value for the exact scope being edited (including inheritance), so
 * there is no scope or brand resolution to get wrong here.
 *
 * The never-taxed decision itself is delegated to
 * Two\Gateway\Model\Config\NeverTaxedTreatment, shared with the backend
 * model, so the warning covers exactly the set the save refuses.
