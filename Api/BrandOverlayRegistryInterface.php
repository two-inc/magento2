/**
 * Registry of brand-overlay packages that have declared themselves
 * present in this Magento install.
 *
 * Overlay packages (e.g. Overlay_Gateway) register their payment method
 * code with the registry via DI, telling Two_Gateway "an alternative
 * brand-bound payment method is installed alongside me". Two_Gateway
 * uses this to drive UX decisions like hiding the parent-brand
 * `two_payment` admin config section so merchants don't see two
 * configurable payment groups by default.
 *
 * Behaviour:
 *   - Empty registry (no overlays declared) = standalone Two_Gateway
 *     install. Admin shows `two_payment` as normal.
 *   - Non-empty registry = at least one overlay installed. Admin
 *     hides `two_payment` by default; merchant opts in to re-show
 *     via `two_brand_synthesis/hide_payment_section/enabled = 0`.
