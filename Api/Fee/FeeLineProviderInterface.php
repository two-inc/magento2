/**
 * Contract for a provider that itemizes ONE specific known third-party
 * fee-type total — a totals-collector amount that bumps grand_total the
 * same way Magento's own shipping total does, without being a quote/order
 * item — into real line item(s) with that fee's actual gross/net/tax
 * amounts and tax rate, by reading that fee directly from the vendor's
 * own data.
 *
 * Required for any fee whose extension runs its own credit-memo total
 * collector, and for one that computes its OWN tax outside Magento's tax
 * engine. Order::findVerifiedResidualTaxRate() can reconcile a
 * well-behaved extension's tax rate for the API payload, but reconciling
 * a fee as a residual also offers it to the merchant to refund through
 * Model\Total\Creditmemo\OtherCharges — which double-refunds a fee its
 * own extension already accounts for on the credit memo.
 *
 * Registered providers run before Order::getOtherChargesLineItem()'s
 * fallback chain, so any residual it still has to reconcile is smaller
 * (or gone).
 *
 * Building one for a specific extension requires that extension's real
 * field/table names, verified against an actual install, not guessed at
 * from documentation.
