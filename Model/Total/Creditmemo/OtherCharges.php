/**
 * Creditmemo total collector for a fee no sales document itemizes.
 *
 * A fee reaching the order's grand total through a totals collector rather
 * than a quote item belongs to no item and no shipping, so nothing carries it
 * onto a credit memo and the merchant cannot refund it. This puts the order's
 * residual back, prorated by refunded subtotal share and capped by what
 * earlier credit memos already took.
 *
 * A fee whose own extension runs a credit-memo total collector is NOT that
 * case — it has an owner deciding what a memo carries, so it must be claimed
 * by an Api\Fee\FeeLineProviderInterface and never reach the residual.
 *
 * Nothing here knows which extension the fee came from; the residual is
 * defined by what the grand total exceeds once every provider has claimed.
