/**
 * Resolves the commit a deployed Two module is running.
 *
 * Three deployment shapes exist in the wild and all three must resolve:
 *
 *  1. gitSync dev install. No composer package at all; `app/code/Two/Gateway`
 *     is a symlink to the synced checkout, whose `.git` is a gitlink FILE
 *     (`gitdir: ../../.git/worktrees/<sha>`) — gitSync v4 names each
 *     worktree directory after the SHA it points at. The `gitdir:` target is
 *     typically DANGLING inside the container, so the SHA is string-parsed
 *     out of the gitlink; never shell out to `git`.
 *  2. Composer/Packagist install (the 2.0 merchant distribution). The
 *     module lives under vendor/ with no .git of any kind; Composer's
 *     installed registry records the exact source/dist reference —
 *     `Composer\InstalledVersions::getReference('two-inc/magento2')`
 *     returns the full release SHA.
 *  3. Zip drop. A branding overlay may ship as a release-asset / GCS zip that is
 *     unpacked straight into `app/code`, carrying neither a `.git` nor a
 *     Composer registry entry — so neither signal above exists. `make
 *     archive` stamps a `.two-deployed-commit` file into the zip at build
 *     time to close that gap.
 *
 * Resolution order is `.git` gitlink → Composer reference →
 * `.two-deployed-commit` stamp. The order is freshness-ranked, not
 * confidence-ranked: the gitlink is the only signal that reflects what is
 * checked out *right now*, the Composer reference is recorded once at
 * install time, and the build stamp is frozen at build time and so is the
 * most likely of the three to be stale. Whichever is freshest and present
 * wins; a malformed signal falls through to the next rather than winning.
 *
 * None present (a plain source drop with no stamp) is a legitimate state:
 * every entry point returns '' rather than throwing, so callers degrade to a
 * bare version string and the admin panel still renders.
 *
 * Note the SHA is repo-wide, not module-unique: for a repo that ships two
 * modules from sub-paths (an overlay package's `plugin/` and `hyva/`) both
 * legitimately report the same commit.
 *
 * This class is the single owner of that logic. The admin Version block and
 * the config Repository (which stamps the SHA onto the `client_v` telemetry
 * parameter) both consume it; neither duplicates the parsing.
