/**
 * Product Tax Class options for the surcharge tax treatment selector.
 *
 * The selector is NEVER auto-defaulted: the empty value renders as an
 * explicit "-- Select surcharge tax treatment --" placeholder, and the
 * backend model (Two\Gateway\Model\Config\Backend\SurchargeTaxClass)
 * blocks the config save while surcharges are enabled and no real
 * treatment has been chosen. This is a deliberate cross-platform rule
 * (WooCommerce / PrestaShop / Magento): tax treatment is a merchant
 * decision, not something the plugin guesses from store defaults.
 *
 * The "Custom" option is a pure backward-compat carve-out for the
 * deprecated flat-rate field (custom_surcharge_tax_rate, stored at
 * config key `surcharge_tax_rate`). It is offered ONLY when that
 * legacy config value genuinely exists — a configured rate of 0 or
 * "0.00" is still a real value and still surfaces the option (hence
 * the explicit null/'' check, never a truthy check). Fresh installs
 * and merchants who never used the flat rate can never select (or
 * create) a custom rate.
 *
 * The delegate's option list includes "None" (value 0) plus every
 * Product Tax Class; selecting a class routes surcharge tax through
 * TaxCalculationInterface with full destination/rule resolution.
 *
 * Never-taxed options are REMOVED from that list (TWO-25279): core's
 * "None" (class id 0), and the "Payment Terms Surcharge - No Tax" class
 * the plugin itself used to provision. Neither is a tax rule the
 * merchant configured, and selecting either silently means "the
 * surcharge is never taxed, in any jurisdiction" — a tax decision made
 * by picking an option we handed them. Same rule across the WooCommerce
 * / PrestaShop / Magento plugins: an untaxed surcharge must be a Tax
 * Rule with a 0% rate that the merchant created.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO grandfathering. A scope that already stores a
 * never-taxed value does not get the option back; instead
 * Two\Gateway\Block\Adminhtml\System\Config\Field\SurchargeTaxClass
 * renders a loud admin error on that field, and
 * Two\Gateway\Model\Config\Backend\SurchargeTaxClass refuses to save
 * the value. The merchant is told plainly to pick a real tax rule rather
 * than being left on a silent zero.
