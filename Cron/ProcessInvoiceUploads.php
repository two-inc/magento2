/**
 * Runs the network-bound part of the self-invoice upload flow
 * (render + 3-step upload) for orders the fulfilment observer left in
 * UPLOADING, so that work never runs inline in the HTTP request that
 * handles the shipment (see UploadService::queueForOrder /
 * SalesOrderShipmentAfter).
 *
 * A single order's worst-case latency across the 3 upload steps can
 * exceed the 1-minute schedule (etc/crontab.xml), so nothing here
 * guarantees the previous tick has finished before the next one starts
 * — and Magento's cron scheduler only guarantees single-execution of
 * one *schedule row*, not job-code-level mutual exclusion across ticks
 * or replicas. Each order is claimed via a non-blocking
 * LockManagerInterface lock before upload() runs, so an overlapping
 * tick (or a second cron-eligible pod) skips an order already being
 * worked instead of racing UploadService's read-modify-write on the
 * same row (TWO-24758).
