# Brand overlay guide

How to build a brand overlay module on top of `Two_Gateway` — a brand
overlay edition that rebrands the payment method without forking any code.

## Architecture in one paragraph

Every module may ship an `etc/brand.xml`. At runtime
`Two\Gateway\Model\Brand\Loader` enumerates installed modules via
`ComponentRegistrar`, parses each `brand.xml` into an immutable
`Two\Gateway\Model\Brand\Descriptor`, and
`Two\Gateway\Model\Brand\ActiveBrandResolver` picks the single active
brand for the install. Brand-aware code reads identity values through
`Two\Gateway\Api\BrandRegistryInterface`, whose default DI binding
(`Two\Gateway\Brand\DescriptorBackedBrandRegistry`) delegates to the
resolved descriptor. An overlay therefore changes behaviour by
_declaring data_, not by overriding classes.

## The single-overlay invariant

`ActiveBrandResolver` enforces **max one overlay brand atop Two**:

-   Two alone → Two is active.
-   Two + one overlay → the overlay is active.
-   Three or more brands → `DomainException` at first `resolve()`.

The resolver caches the active descriptor in-process. There is no
per-store-view brand switching; one install, one brand.

## Files an overlay module needs

```
your-overlay/
  registration.php        ComponentRegistrar::register + (optionally) a
                          class_alias for a legacy gateway FQCN — never a
                          subclass file, so autoload doesn't force-resolve
                          the parent at di:compile mid-upgrade
  etc/
    module.xml            <sequence> MUST list Magento_Backend,
                          Magento_Config, Magento_Payment AND Two_Gateway
                          explicitly: module sequence is not transitively
                          walked at config-merge time, and a missing entry
                          makes the admin section override silently no-op
                          on alphabetical-sort installs
    brand.xml             the brand declaration (schema below)
    di.xml                virtualType for the payment method +
                          BrandOverlayRegistry entry (below)
    config.xml            payment-method defaults (install-time only;
                          existing core_config_data rows are never
                          rewritten)
    payment.xml           gateway entry — carries NO <model> element
                          (that lives in config.xml)
    acl.xml               your `<Vendor>_<Module>::config` resource
    csp_whitelist.xml     if your brand adds origins
  view/                   logo + palette only — no PHP/view-model overrides
  i18n/                   brand-specific strings
```

Conventions enforced across the overlay ecosystem (see AGENTS.md, the
parity block): `composer.json` carries no `version:` field;
`etc/module.xml` omits `setup_version`; `payment.xml` carries no
`<model>`.

## di.xml wiring

Two things, both small:

```xml
<!-- Payment-method registration: a virtualType over the generic
     method. The brand's `code` is the only override; every other
     constructor argument resolves by type through the ObjectManager,
     so new required parent constructor params auto-inject. -->
<virtualType name="Acme\Gateway\Model\AcmePayment"
             type="Two\Gateway\Model\GenericPaymentMethod">
    <arguments>
        <argument name="code" xsi:type="string">acme_payment</argument>
    </arguments>
</virtualType>

<!-- Declare the overlay so brand-aware machinery can enumerate it -->
<type name="Two\Gateway\Model\BrandOverlayRegistry">
    <arguments>
        <argument name="overlays" xsi:type="array">
            <item name="acme_payment" xsi:type="string">acme_payment</item>
        </argument>
    </arguments>
</type>
```

Do **not** rebind `BrandRegistryInterface`, ship per-brand virtualTypes
for blocks/view-models, or override admin sections in your own
system.xml — brand identity resolves at request time via the active
descriptor, and admin sections are synthesised from the canonical
template (see `suppressed_fields` below for per-brand control hiding).

## brand.xml schema reference

Root: `<config>` with one or more `<brand>` elements (`brand.xsd`
enforces unique `code` per file; `Loader` throws on duplicate codes
across modules). Elements may appear in any order (`xs:all`).

**`<brand>` attributes**

| `intent_declined_notice`         | no       | string                    | Copy override for the declined notice. Never an off switch, but non-blank copy turns an undeclared declined switch ON. **See below.**                            |

### The intent notices — a switch and a wording override per outcome

The notices are buyer-facing "order intent approved" / "order intent not
approved" lines rendered inline in the checkout payment tile — as of
TWO-25326, this is the ONLY place the buyer's captured company NAME is
displayed in the tile; the earlier standalone `.two-company-label`
element is gone, not relocated. The company NUMBER renders separately,
independent of these notices, in the `.two-company-id-text` label each
capture panel paints under its own company field. Each outcome has its
**own** on/off switch and its **own** wording override, and the four
elements are four independent decisions: a brand may reword the declined
notice, suppress it, or leave it on the platform default, whatever it did
with the approved one.

The switches govern the buyer-facing COPY only. A not-approved order intent
also blocks placement — the renderer records the verdict against the
captured organisation number and `placeOrder()` refuses on it, so a brand
with the notices off still cannot submit an order Two has declined
(TWO-25657). The buyer then gets `generalErrorMessage` instead of the
declined sentence.

**Do not overload a switch with wording meaning** — an off switch
expressed as the absence of content is indistinguishable from an
unfinished string, and any tidy-up that deletes the "empty, unused"
declaration silently turns the notice back on.

#### `intent_approved_notice_enabled` / `intent_declined_notice_enabled` — the switches

Explicit boolean only, each governing its own outcome. **They are not
symmetrical.** The approved switch is an on/off switch. The declined one
chooses between the brand's wording and the platform's, because that
sentence is the buyer's only account of why the Place Order button is
disabled, and a switchable explanation for a blocked control is the defect
ABN-563 reports.

| `<…_notice_enabled>false</…_notice_enabled>`       | Approved: **suppressed entirely** — no element is emitted into the DOM, not an empty wrapper.

| element absent                                     | Approved: documented explicit default **`true`**. Declined: see the precedence below.                                        |
| anything else (`1`, `0`, `yes`, empty, whitespace) | **Error.** Never a silent third behaviour.                                                                                   |

An overlay that wants no approved notice and no branded decline wording
declares both switches `false`. A declined buyer is still told why.

The declined switch is newer than the approved one, so it resolves with
an inheritance. A declared `intent_declined_notice_enabled` decides.
Absent that, the brand's own wording is used when **either**
`intent_declined_notice` is non-blank — shipped wording is intent to use
it — **or** `intent_approved_notice_enabled` resolved to `true`. An overlay
declaring only the approved switch therefore keeps withholding both, which
is what it meant before the declined elements existed. A visually-blank
`intent_declined_notice` is inert here as everywhere: it
neither renders nor turns the switch on, and non-breaking and zero-width
spaces both count as blank.

Absent-means-`true` is deliberate for `intent_approved_notice_enabled`
(and so, through the inheritance above, for an overlay declaring neither
switch): it keeps a third-party overlay that declares nothing on ON. Base
plugins declare both switches `true` explicitly anyway, so the file states
its position rather than relying on omission.

The invalid case is caught twice, because `brand.xsd` is not validated at
runtime (see the validation warning below):

-   `brand.xsd` restricts the element to the enumeration `true|false`, so
    developer-mode config validation fails loudly; and
-   `Model\Brand\Loader` throws a `\DomainException` naming the offending
    `brand.xml` path, the element and the bad value — the same treatment
    `<surcharge_rounding_steps>` gets in the same method.

Note `xs:boolean` is deliberately **not** used: it would also accept `1`
and `0`, and this switch is meant to read as a decision.

`Descriptor::getIntentApprovedNotice()` and `getIntentDeclinedNotice()`
return `null` for the first two rows and the template for the third; they
never return `''`.

**Every white-label brand overlay is expected to declare
`intent_approved_notice`** with brand-specific copy — falling through to
the platform default here for a live overlay is a bug, not a valid "no
opinion" state. `intent_declined_notice` carries no such expectation:
rewording the declined outcome is a choice an overlay makes or declines to
make, and the platform default is a valid resting state.

#### Deploy order

**Merge order is `magento-plugin` (parent, owns the parsing) → the brand
overlay repo → `magento-hyva-extension`.** Out of order there is a window
in which Hyvä renders the approved notice for a brand that asked for it off.

The declined switch's fallback to the approved one means an existing
overlay needs no change to land alongside a parent that parses the
declined pair: an overlay declaring only the approved switch behaves
byte-identically before and after.

Hyvä honours the declined pair only from its own parity change,
`magento-hyva-extension` PR #141. Until that lands, Hyvä renders the
declined notice regardless of what an overlay declares.

An overlay that declares an empty `<intent_approved_notice>` and no
`<intent_approved_notice_enabled>` resolves to notice **ON** — wrong for a
brand that wants it off, but not broken. Empty deliberately stays inert
rather than being a hard error: that would turn a wrong notice into a
broken store. Declare the boolean.

Hyvä guards the reverse skew with `method_exists()` against a parent that
lacks the registry method — a missing method means "no brand opinion",
i.e. notice ON.

The company-unknown copy variant always stays on the platform default.
In practice it is unreachable: an order intent is only ever placed once
the buyer's company name **and** company number are known.

A company number is not always DISPLAYABLE, though, even when it is
known. A value beginning with the literal prefix `TWO:` is an internal
reference rather than a registry number and is never shown to the buyer
on any surface. In the notice sentence the renderer then removes the
company-number token **together with the brackets around it**, so the
copy reads `… by Acme Ltd …`, never `… by Acme Ltd () …`. An override
that places `%3` outside brackets is handled the same way. If you are
writing override copy, do not assume the number will be present.

**Keep `%3` inside round or square brackets in override copy.** The
renderer removes the token together with a bracket pair around it; it
does not know about other separators, so copy shaped `%2 – %3` or
`%2, %3` leaves the dangling separator behind when the number is
withheld.

This plugin's storefront renderer (Luma/Amasty/Fire, one shared code
path) emits each notice as a persistent inline element with class
`two-order-intent-message approved` / `two-order-intent-message declined`
inside the payment-method tile.

Both `_enabled` switches are XSD enumerations here, so an invalid value
throws rather than falling back to a default.

### A warning about validation

`brand.xsd` is enforced by CI/IDE tooling only — **nothing validates
brand.xml against the schema at runtime** (`Loader` uses plain
`simplexml_load_file`; the `xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation` hint is
passive). Two consequences:

1. A typo'd element is **silently ignored**, not rejected. Deploying an
   overlay that uses a new element against an older parent that doesn't
   parse it produces a silently-absent feature, not a deploy failure.
   Always verify the feature's observable behaviour after deploy.
2. Where silent mis-parsing would be dangerous, `Loader` carries its own
   guards (duplicate/empty `code`, `<surcharge_rounding_steps>`,
   `<intent_approved_notice_enabled>`, `<intent_declined_notice_enabled>`)
   that throw `DomainException` at load.
   Follow that pattern when you add fields whose zero-value would
   silently disable a constraint.

## suppressed_fields: hiding admin controls per brand

```xml
<suppressed_fields>
    <field path="payment/payment_terms/payment_terms_duration_days"/>
</suppressed_fields>
```

A brand's admin surface comes ENTIRELY from
`etc/adminhtml/brand_form_template.xml`:
`Plugin\Config\Structure\HidePaymentSection` hides the static Two sections
once an overlay is installed, and the deep merge with `system.xml` only
overrides fields the template already declares. So a field — or a field's
`source_model`, `backend_model` or `frontend_model` — added to `system.xml`
alone is wired on no brand at all, and a missing `backend_model` means a
save-time guard that silently does not exist for every partner while it
still passes on Two. Declare both, in both files;
`BrandFormModelWiringParityTest` and `DiagnosticsSectionParityTest` are the
guards.

`path` is `section_suffix/group/field` against the synthesised section
(`{section_prefix}_payment` → `payment_terms` group here).
`SynthesiseBrandAdminForm` sets `showInDefault/Website/Store="0"` on
the matching field during section injection: the control stays declared
in the canonical template but doesn't render for this brand.

**A suppressed field is not POSTED**, so any save-time guard that reads
its submitted value silently stops enforcing for this brand — and a
guard that refused the save on the strength of that read would brick the
whole section, since the merchant has no control to fix. Suppressing a
field whose invariant is enforced elsewhere is a decision to drop the
invariant for this brand, not just to hide a control. Use this
instead of shipping a `<section>` stub in the overlay's system.xml —
a static stub inserts itself into the merged Structure first and
short-circuits the synthesised section ordering.

**TWO-25386 moved some fields to a different section suffix.** `title`,
`subtitle`, `sort_order`, `sallowspecific`/`specificcountry`,
`merchant_minimum_order(_basis)` and `enable_order_intent` now live
under `{section_prefix}_checkout_fields` (groups `display`/
`availability`) instead of `{section_prefix}_payment`;
`fulfill_trigger`, `fulfill_order_status` and `enable_tax_subtotals`
now live under `{section_prefix}_order_management` (group
`order_management`) instead of `{section_prefix}_payment`/`advanced`.
Any `suppressed_fields` entry targeting one of those fields by its old
`payment/advanced/…` or `payment/payment_method/…` path needs its
`section_suffix` segment updated to match, or the suppression silently
stops matching and the field reappears for that brand.

`trusted_proxies` lives under `{section_prefix}_version` (group
`admin_controls`) instead of `{section_prefix}_general` (group `general`).
An overlay's `suppressed_fields` entry for it needs its path updated from
`general/general/…` to `version/admin_controls/…`.

**Two fields were retired.** `firewall_token` (under `general/general`)
and `firewall_token_browser` (under `version/admin_controls`) are replaced
by `custom_headers`, a header table under `version/admin_controls`. A
`suppressed_fields` entry naming either retired field matches nothing and
should suppress `version/admin_controls/custom_headers` instead.

## Worked example: adding a brand-driven field

`surcharge_rounding_steps` is the reference implementation for extending
`BrandRegistryInterface` with a new brand-driven value. Six touch
points, in dependency order:

1. **Schema** — `etc/brand.xsd`: add the element to `brandType`
   (optional, `minOccurs="0"`, so existing brand.xml files stay valid)
   plus its type. Constrain what you can there
   (`surchargeRoundingStepsType` → `positiveDecimalType`), and document
   the accepted values in an XSD comment.

2. **Loader** — `Model/Brand/Loader.php` `buildDescriptor()`: parse the
   element, **normalise and validate** — because nothing validates the
   xsd at runtime, a typo'd value would otherwise coerce to `0.0` and
   silently disable whatever it drives. Throw `DomainException` naming
   the brand.xml path, the element and the bad value. Pass the result as
   a constructor argument to `Descriptor`.

3. **Value object** — `Model/Brand/Descriptor.php`: append a readonly
   constructor property + getter.

4. **Interface + adapter** — `Api/BrandRegistryInterface.php`: declare
   the getter with the full return-shape docblock (null = feature
   absent). `Brand/DescriptorBackedBrandRegistry.php`: delegate to the
   resolved descriptor.

5. **Consumer** — the code that reads the value lands in the same PR
   (no speculative brand fields).

6. **Tests** — unit tests for the Loader parse/validation and the
   consumer's boundaries.

**Release ordering:** the parent release containing steps 1–6 must be
deployed before an overlay brand.xml that uses the new element —
on an older parent the element is silently ignored (see the validation
warning above), so verify the feature's observable behaviour after
deploy.

**brand.xml or the API?** Reserve brand.xml for values that are
intrinsically brand-static: URLs, labels, CSP origins, admin-form shape.

Anything the platform owns and may change per merchant comes from
`GET /v1/merchant`, never brand.xml, so the storefront and the API
can never disagree:

-   minimum order value — `min_order_amount/currency/basis`, read via
    `Service/Order/MinimumOrderProvider` and enforced by
    `Service/Order/MinimumOrderGate`;
-   offerable payment terms — `available_terms`, read via
    `Service/Merchant/SettingsProvider`;
-   buyer-surcharge cap — `surcharge_limit`, same provider;
-   buyer-country allowlist — `supported_buyer_countries`, read via
    `Service/Merchant/SupportedCountriesProvider` and applied by
    `Model\Two::canUseForCountry()` alongside core's own
    `sallowspecific`/`specificcountry` restriction, then again at
    placement (`Model\Two::authorize()`) and on the order-intent route.
    Both gates must concede. A record with no allowlist field restricts
    nothing; a field that is present but empty, null or malformed allows
    no country at all, as does a restricted merchant whose buyer country
    cannot be resolved.

## Local development

`make up` in this repo runs a vanilla Magento dev stack on port 1234;
a brand overlay repo's `make up` typically runs a brand-flavoured stack
on a different port — both can co-run. The overlay repo's `dev/install.sh` supports
`BASE=released|develop|tag:|sha:|ref:|path:` to test an overlay against
any parent version, which is exactly what the release-ordering caveat
above requires before shipping a new brand field.
