/**
 * Cached, categorised outcome of GET /v1/merchant/verify_api_key for the
 * currently-stored API key.
 *
 * Two jobs, both of which used to be done ad-hoc by each caller:
 *
 * 1. CATEGORISE. Every non-200 outcome used to be reported identically
 *    ("API key is not valid"), so an admin whose store simply could not
 *    reach the API was told their key was wrong and went looking for the
 *    wrong fix. getStatus() sorts the outcome into buckets an admin can
 *    act on: OK, INVALID_KEY (401/403 — the key really is wrong),
 *    SERVICE_ERROR (5xx — the key may be fine, the service is not),
 *    UNREACHABLE (no HTTP exchange completed at all: DNS, TLS, routing,
 *    timeout), ERROR (some other non-2xx status), MALFORMED_RESPONSE (a
 *    2xx that did not carry a merchant id) and NOT_CONFIGURED (no key
 *    saved yet).
 *
 * 2. CACHE. The verification result gates checkout — the payment method's
 *    availability and the checkout config subtree that the company-search
 *    control is mounted behind — and both of those are evaluated on every
 *    cart/checkout render. A live HTTP round-trip per render is not
 *    acceptable, so results are memoised per request and cached across
 *    requests, following the same protocol as the sibling providers in
 *    this namespace ({@see RecordProvider}) and Service\Fx\RateTableProvider.
 *
 * Cache protocol:
 * - Keyed on a hash of the API key AND the resolved mode, so correcting
 *   the key, pointing it at a different merchant, or switching
 *   sandbox <-> production all miss the cache immediately and re-verify
 *   rather than serving the previous verdict. The mode belongs in the key
 *   because it decides which host the key is verified against, and two
 *   store views can share a key while being configured to different modes.
 * - A success is cached for CACHE_LIFETIME (5 min). Short enough that a
 *   key which is revoked upstream stops being honoured within minutes,
 *   long enough that checkout renders cost nothing.
 * - A failure is cached for FAILURE_CACHE_LIFETIME (1 min) rather than
 *   not at all: while the API is unreachable, every checkout render would
 *   otherwise add its own timing-out HTTP call to the page. Same reasoning
 *   as RateTableProvider's failure cooldown, with a short TTL so a
 *   recovery (or a corrected key) is picked up quickly.
 * - refresh() bypasses the cache for a live check and writes the result
 *   forward into it. The admin settings page uses that, so a merchant who
 *   has just corrected a broken key does not have to wait out the TTL for
 *   checkout to notice.
 *
 * The raw response body is deliberately NOT part of the returned status
 * for any failure category — only the bucket and the HTTP status code.
 * Verification failures are surfaced to a merchant in the admin UI and an
 * upstream error body is not something to render there.
