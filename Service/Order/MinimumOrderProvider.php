/**
 * Resolves the merchant's minimum order value from the Two API.
 *
 * GET /v1/merchant/{id} carries the effective minimum (funding-partner
 * default with any merchant override, resolved server-side) as
 * min_order_amount / min_order_currency / min_order_basis. That is the
 * single source of truth: the same value the API enforces at
 * order create/intent, so the storefront gate and the server can never
 * disagree on the threshold.
 *
 * The merchant record is fetched and cached once by RecordProvider;
 * this class only projects the min_order_* tuple out of it. A record
 * that cannot be resolved (or one without a minimum) yields null: the
 * server still enforces, and hiding the payment method on an API blip
 * would be the worse failure.
