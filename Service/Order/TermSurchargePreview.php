 * Per-term surcharge previews for the checkout term chips.
 *
 * Shared by both anonymous surcharge endpoints (Model\Webapi\Surcharges and
 * Model\Webapi\TermSelection) so a chip shows the same amount whichever one
 * last answered.
 *
 * Every entry carries net AND gross; the chip renders whichever
 * `tax/cart_display/price` calls for. The tax rate is resolved once per
 * request — it is a property of the tax class and destination, not of the
 * term — and applied to each term's net.
