         * reaches.

         * (`Magento_Checkout/js/view/shipping.js` → `checkoutData

         * the fields render. So the provider is the persistence boundary, and
         * only a value the provider has SEEN is restored.
         *
         * The company NAME crosses that boundary for free: the panel fires a
         * `change` on the input when a result is picked, `ui/form/
         * element/input`'s `value:` binding reads the DOM on `change`, and the
         * element's `value` observable is two-way linked to its provider path.
         * The company NUMBER had no such route — it is written by us, not by a
         * widget, and a jQuery `.val()` write raises no event Knockout listens
         * for. The provider therefore never learned the number, nothing was
         * saved, and there was nothing to restore.
         *
         * Writing through the component is what publishes to the provider; the
         * DOM write is kept for the same reason `setCompanyIdDisabled()` keeps
         * one — `uiRegistry.get()` yields nothing if this runs before the
         * component registers, and `needsManualCompanyId()` reads the field's
         * value straight off the DOM in the same tick.
         *
         * Deliberately NOT done by triggering `change` on the input instead:
         * that would also fire our own change handler, which republishes the
         * `companyData` customer-data section — and the payment step reads a
         * change NOTIFICATION on that section as an act of selection, so every
         * pick would announce itself twice.
         *
         * The DOM write goes FIRST. The component write notifies subscribers

         * therefore gets country-checked against the stamp of the PREVIOUS,
         * searched company. Also unreachable while the field is CSS-hidden, and
