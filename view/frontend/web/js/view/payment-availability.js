/**
 * Re-evaluates payment-method availability when the quote totals change.
 *
 * Whether the Two method is offered depends on the order value via the
 * server-side minimum-order gate (Model\Two::isAvailable). On Luma the
 * payment-service caches the method list from the last
 * set-shipping-information / payment-information fetch and never re-filters
 * it when totals move afterwards (a later shipping-method switch, a coupon
 * applied on the payment step), so a basket crossing the threshold keeps its
 * stale visibility until a full checkout reload. Hyvä and FireCheckout
 * re-fetch on every totals change and are unaffected; this gives Luma (and
 * Luma-derived one-step checkouts) the same behaviour. A derivative that never
 * persists the shipping choice mid-flow gets nothing from this component: the
 * server it would ask cannot see the change, so the basket check below rejects
 * every answer.
 *
 * On a genuine totals change it re-fetches the payment-information endpoint
 * (the server re-runs isAvailable) and applies the returned method list ONLY
 * WHEN the set of available methods actually changed. Three constraints drive
 * that:
 *   - It applies a response only when the order value the server judged is the
 *     one that triggered the refresh. isAvailable runs against the PERSISTED
 *     quote, which lags a client-estimated shipping choice (saved only by
 *     set-shipping-information), so a mismatched verdict is about a different
 *     basket: publishing one withheld the method on a stale below-minimum
 *     total that then never moved, so nothing restored it (ABN-509).
 *   - It never calls quote.setTotals(). The shared core action
 *     (get-payment-information) does, which stamps the server's possibly-
 *     pre-shipping totals over the correctly-collected client totals — the
 *     regression that got the first attempt reverted.
 *   - It skips paymentService.setPaymentMethods() when the method set is
 *     unchanged. That call swaps the availablePaymentMethods observable with
 *     fresh object references, which makes Luma's payment list rebuild EVERY
 *     renderer — wiping a half-filled Two form and the selected method. We
 *     only want to add/remove Two as it crosses the minimum, not churn the
 *     list on every totals tick.
 *
 * Server isAvailable + place-order + API enforcement stay the sole source of
 * truth; no minimum logic is duplicated here.
 *
 * Mounted from checkout_index_index.xml under the always-present sidebar,
 * NOT under the Two payment renderer: when the method is hidden its renderer
 * is not instantiated, so a refresher living there could never bring it back.
