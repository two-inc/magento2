/**
 * Shared surcharge state for checkout.
 *
 * Chip values are deferred: rendered as an empty observable on first paint
 * (template shows a loader), then populated asynchronously after Magento's
 * /totals-information settles. This avoids the basis divergence that
 * server-side computation suffered (subtotal-only at HTML render time vs
 * subtotal+shipping after collectTotals re-runs).
 *
 * The first fetch is gated on the quote.getTotals() subscriber rather than
 * running at module load — server-rendered totals are pre-shipping and
 * fetching against them would just move the basis bug client-side. On
 * every subsequent totals change (coupon, shipping address, etc.) we
 * refetch; the calculator has a request-scoped response cache so duplicate
 * calls are free, and correctness beats the few KB of saved bandwidth.
