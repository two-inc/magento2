/**
 * TWO-25503: the company the buyer is paying as — name, registry number, where
 * the number came from, and which of the three capture options produced them.
 *
 * Magento's counterpart to WooCommerce's `twoincCompanyCapture`, which owns the
 * same subject there: the name/number pair and which input surface is active.
 *
 * A FACTORY, not a singleton: TWO-25554 split one page-level identity into
 * one per address panel (shipping, billing), each outliving a payment-method
 * list rebuild the same way the old singleton had to — Luma, Amasty and Fire
 * Checkout all re-create payment renderers on every totals change, and Hyvä's
 * Magewire rebuilds the whole subtree, but none of them re-create the two
 * identity instances themselves. A third instance (`company-source-resolver.js`'s
 * `resolvedIdentity`) is the buyer's actual paying-as company — the one
 * downstream consumer (order-intent, `Service\Order`) reads.
 *
 * FRAMEWORK-FREE, for the same reason `company-search-panel.js` is: both
 * checkouts load this one file, and Hyvä ships no Knockout to hold observables
 * in. Reads are plain calls and every write notifies `subscribe()`, which is
 * what a host with its own reactivity bridges to — Luma mirrors it onto
 * `ko.observable`s in the renderer, Alpine reads it directly.
 *
 * Owns the state and nothing else. Who may write it, and the DOM it is captured
 * through, belong to the capture component and to each host's transport.
