     * and a registered-company search hit — deliberately NOT special cased
     * per source.
     *
     *  - a `building`/`apartment` is the more specific locator and takes LINE
     *    1, moving `street` to line 2. With both present they are joined
     *    most-specific-first, the way an address is read aloud ("Apartment 4,
     *    Mill House");
     *  - with neither present, `street` takes line 1 and line 2 is left ALONE —
     *    absent from the returned object rather than written empty, so a
     *    payload that says nothing about a second line cannot blank one the
     *    buyer typed.
     *
     * NO de-duplication between the two lines even when the text is identical:
     * real addresses legitimately repeat a line, so suppressing the second one
     * would discard something the registry actually sent.
     *
     * `street_address` is the company-detail response's spelling for the
     * street, `street` the autofill buyer record's. Coalesced here so both
     * callers share one mapping rather than each translating its own payload.
     *
     * A shop configured for a single street line has no second line to route
     * to, so the two parts are joined onto line 1 there rather than the street
     * being written to a field that does not exist and lost.
     *
     * @param {object} address company address or buyer address record

         * Called when the buyer switches country: an address autofilled from
         * the previous country's registry is not a hint about the new one, it
         * is a wrong address the buyer may well not re-read before placing the
         * order.

         * `root` is required — the calling panel's OWN form, and the only one
         * touched. A page-wide retraction cleared the shipping form's address
         * fields when the buyer changed their BILLING country (TWO-25554).
         *
         * Only fields still holding EXACTLY what applyAddress() put there are
         * cleared. Anything the buyer has since edited — and anything that was
         * never autofilled at all, including a whole form they filled by hand —
         * has no matching recording and is left alone. That asymmetry is the
         * point: over-clearing here silently deletes buyer input on a keystroke
         * they may have made minutes ago, which is worse than leaving a stale
         * value they can see and correct.
         *
         * `change` is fired only for fields actually cleared, so Magento's
         * address-form bookkeeping sees the same event shape it does for a
         * buyer edit.
