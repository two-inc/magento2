/**
 * TWO-25554: which of the two address panels' captured companies is the
 * buyer's actual paying-as company.
 *
 * Shipping's capture wins while billing is not a distinct address. Once the
 * buyer makes billing distinct, billing's capture wins, falling back to
 * shipping when billing carries no company number to bill against.
 *
 * Never a hybrid of the two: `resolved` is always a live mirror of exactly ONE
 * of `shipping`/`billing`, so a downstream reader (order-intent, the tile's own
 * display) sees one coherent company. What travels is `snapshot()`'s business —
 * the company fields alone; each panel's own UI state stays with the panel that
 * renders it.
 *
 * FRAMEWORK-FREE, for the same reason its two inputs are: both checkouts
 * load this file, and Hyvä ships no Knockout.
